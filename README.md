## Prerequisites and Installation
Actually, running the project is quite simple. To run and use the application successfully, you need to have the latest dotnet sdk installed on your computer. Then you need to have a Sql Server database for the database. If you have completed your installations completely, the first thing you need to do is to add migration, you can do this with the help of the "migrations add InitialCreate" command in the Package Manager Console. Then you can use the "update-database" command to install our database via this migration file.
